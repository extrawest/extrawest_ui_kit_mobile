# extrawest_ui_kit
A flutter package that provides you with ready Material 3 UI components

## Features

1. Basic Material 3 UI componets:
    - Buttons (`Elevated`, `Filled`, `Text`, `Outlined`, `Icon`)
    - Text Fields (Email, Password, Custom)
    - Texts widgets with different [Material 3](https://flutter.github.io/samples/web/material_3_demo/) styles
2. Ready to use Layouts with ability to change components dynamically.
    - Sign In layout with components: Email, Password inputs, Password recovery section, etc.
    - Create Account layout with textfields validation

The advantage of these layouts is that they come with built-in components having default parameters, which also can be customized to fit the application's requirements.

## Usage

There are 2 approaches you can use package's components:
1. Using ready Layouts with specifying needed parameters(or use default ones)
2. Using components separately to your own goals.

```dart
const like = 'sample';
```
